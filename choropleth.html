                Distribution of fatalities and events across Myanmar's regions since February 2021. Major cities are marked in blue while the capital, Naypyidaw, is marked in red.

            <p>
                Historically peaceful, the central Bamar-majority regions of Sagaing and Magway became the stronghold of the armed resistance (People's Defense Forces or PDFs, which is the armed branch of the NUG). Consequently, they have faced the military's harshest scorched-earth campaigns.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                The Sagaing region is arguably the most devastated region in the country, with almost 30,000 deaths.
                <a class="underline text-blue-400" href="https://ispmyanmar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Data-matters-50-eng.pdf">Reports</a> indicate that over 72% of all homes burned down in Myanmar since the coup were in Sagaing.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Magway Region: similar to Sagaing, Magway has seen widespread village burnings and heavy fighting between PDFs and junta forces. It is a critical supply route that the military struggles to control.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">The rest of the country</h2>
            <p>
                Other regions and states have also experienced significant violence, although not to the same extent as Sagaing and Magway. 
                Chin State, Kachin State, and Kayah State have seen increased conflict due to the presence of various ethnic armed organizations allied with the NUG.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                The military has also conducted operations in urban areas, including Yangon and Mandalay, targeting protestors and PDF members. However, the intensity of conflict in these cities is lower compared to rural areas.
            </p>

                Of note is a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55901774" class="underline text-blue-400">very famous video</a> of an aerobics teacher, Ms Khing, who was filming a routine dance workout when a stream of military vehicles passed by in the background as the
                military was seizing the government, in what became the most iconic video of the coup.
