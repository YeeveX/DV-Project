                Historically peaceful, the central Bamar-majority regions of Sagaing and Magway became the stronghold of the armed resistance (People's Defense Forces or PDFs, which is the armed branch of the NUG). Consequently, they have faced the military's harshest scorched-earth campaigns.

                Magway Region: similar to Sagaing, Magway has seen widespread village burnings and heavy fighting between PDFs and junta forces. It is a critical supply route that the military struggles to control.
