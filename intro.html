            In recent times, most of the world's attention has been focused on the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Middle East, but Myanmar's situation is equally dire and deserves more awareness and understanding. Myanmar is the <a class="underline text-blue-400" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area">39th
            largest country in the world by land area</a>, surpassing Afghanistan, France (considering overseas territories as well) and Ukraine, and has a population of around 51 million people, making it the <a class="underline text-blue-400" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population">29th most populous country in the world</a>, right above South Korea. It is a country rich in natural resources and cultural heritage, but it has been plagued by decades of internal conflict, political instability and human rights abuses.
