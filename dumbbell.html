                Dumbbell chart comparing Myanmar's key economic and humanitarian indicators before and after the 2021 military coup, with other selected countries in the region.
            </p>
            <strong class="underline">Note:</strong> South Korea is included as a reference "first world" country
            with a similar population to remind that the comparison is done between developing countries, all with their own challenges.<br>
            While it's good to have a reference point, the inclusion of South Korea in the chart makes it very hard to see the differences between Myanmar and the other developing countries, which are more relevant for the analysis. 
            For this reason, it's suggested to use the option to exclude South Korea from the chart.

                In most of the selcted indicators, Myanmar is the only country that has seen a decline in the value of the indicator from 2020 to 2021, with the only exception being the unemployment rate,
                performing worse than countries like Venezuela, which has been in a deep economic crisis for years, and Madagascar, which is one of the poorest countries in the world.

            <p class="mt-3">
                The only indicator where Myanmar saw in increase is, unfortunatly, only the militray expenditure, which indicates that the military regime is prioritizing its own power and control over the well-being of the population.

                Keyna, a country with a population similar to Myanmar, had a GDP of 101B USD in 2020, while Myanmar's GDP was only 79B USD. This ~24% difference increased to an incredible
                ~50% in the span of just one year.

            <p class="mt-3">
                Myanmar is the only country in the list besides Madagascar with a GDP per capita below $2000 that, moreover, approached the threshold between low-income and middle-income countries of $1135 as defined by
