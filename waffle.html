                Almost 70% of the politically motivated events recorded in Myanmar since the coup in February 2021 have resulted in at least one death.
                The military regime has responded to widespread protests and civil disobedience with extreme violence, 
                targeting not only protesters but also civilians suspected of supporting the opposition.

                According to data from ACLED, over 70,000 people have been killed in Myanmar since the coup, with most of them dying in armed clashes
                 between the military and various opposition groups.
